# Bicycle
A programming challenge to create a Bicycle class, instantiate it and run it.

## Installation/Usage
clone this project to a directory of your choice with
``git clone git@github.com:gabezerbe/Bicycle.git``

run ``composer install`` in your terminal of choice while in the project directory

run ``php bin/console app:ride-bike`` to check out your new bike!

## Manual
The Bicycle class relies on a few component classes that contain information on parts such as the brakes, wheels, drivetrain etc.
You'll be totally fine just calling `new Bicycle()` however as its constructor has a default set up to produce a Trek bicycle for demonstration purposes.

Below you can find specifications on the classes and their parts.
